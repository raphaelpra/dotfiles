# Swagger Viewer - v2.2.0
**Swagger Viewer lets you preview and validate Swagger 2.0 and OpenAPI files as you type in Visual Studio Code.**

It works on swagger files in json and yaml format. Preview and validation happens in real time as you type.

## Preview

To  start
* Open the swagger file and press F1.
* Run the Command `Preview Swagger`.

OR
* Press  `Shift + Alt + P`

OR
* Right click file in explorer panel and click `Preview Swagger`

THEN

* Preview it in vscode Itself like this

## Configurations

### Opening In External browser

If you want to preview the changes in external browser change the settings `Preview In Browser` to `true` in `User/Workspace Settings`

THEN
* Run the Command `Preview Swagger`.

OR
* Press  `Shift + Alt + P`

**Preview will be automatically opened in default browser.**

### Change Default Port

Default port of the preview url can be changed by changing the `Default Port` value in `User/Workspace Settings`

### Show Only File Name

In the preview title the file name along with the full path is displayed by default. It can be changed to show only the file name by changing the `Show Only File Name` to `true` in `User/Workspace Settings`

### Change Default Host

Default host(localhost) of the preview url can be changed by changing the `swaggerViewer.defaultHost` value in `User/Workspace Settings`

## Validation (Partial)

Swagger Viewer validates your documents against Swagger 2.0 and OpenAPI specifications. If there are any issues it will be shown as a warning in the problems panel. Right now only one validation error will be shown even if there are multiple issues.
