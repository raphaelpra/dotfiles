JS Refactor
===========

JS Refactor is the Javascript automated refactoring tool for Visual Studio Code, built to smooth and streamline your development experience. It provides an extensive list of automated actions including the commonly needed: Extract Method, Extract Variable, Inline Variable, and an alias for the built-in VS Code rename. JS Refactor also supports many common snippets and associated actions for wrapping existing code in common block expressions.

### Supported Language Files ###

- Javascript/ECMAScript (.js)
- HTML (.htm, .html)

## Installation

#### Extensions Panel:
Click on the extensions icon on the left-hand side of your editor.  In the search bar type "JS Refactor." Find the extension in the list and click the install button.

## Automated Refactorings

**Basic usage:** Make a selection, right click and select the refactoring you want to perform from the context menu.

**Command Pallette:** You can press F1 then simply type the name of the refactoring and press enter 
if you know the name of the refactoring you need.

**Shortcuts:** Finally, there are hotkey combinations for some of the most common refactorings you might want. Hotkeys are listed in the keybindings section below.

JS Refactor supports the following refactorings (explanations below):

**Common Refactorings:**
- Extract Method
- Extract Variable
- Inline Variable
- Rename Variable (Alias of VS Code internal command)

**Other Utilities:**
- Convert To Arrow Function
- Convert To Function Expression
- Convert To Template Literal
- Export Function
- Introduce Function
- Lift and Name Function Expression
- Negate Expression
- Shift Parameters
- Wrap selection options:
    - Arrow Function
    - Async Function
    - Condition
    - Function
    - Generator
    - IIFE
    - Try/Catch

### Usage

Select the code you wish to refactor and then press the F1 key to open the command pallette.  Begin typing the name of
the refactoring and select the correct refactoring from the list. You will be prompted for any necessary information.

### Explanations

#### Core Refactorings ####

**Extract Method** Creates new function with original selection as the body.

**Extract Variable** Creates new assigned variable declaration and replaces original selection.

**Inline Variable** Replaces all references to variable with variable initialization expression, deletes variable declaration.

#### Other Utilities ####

**Convert To Arrow Function** Converts a function expression to an arrow function.

**Convert To Template Literal** Converts a string concatenation expression to a template literal.

**Export Function** creates new export declaration for selected function or function name

**Introduce Function** creates new function from existing function call or variable assignment

**Lift and Name Function Expression** Lifts function expression from current context, replacing it with provided name and adds name to expression

**Shift Parameters** Shifts function parameters to the left or right by the selected number of places

**Wrap In Condition** Wraps selected code in an if statement, adding indentation as necessary

**Wrap in function** takes your selected code, at line-level precision, and wraps all of the lines in a named function.

**Wrap in IIFE** wraps selected code in an immediately invoked function expression (IIFE).

## Snippets

JS Refactor supports several common code snippets:

- Anonymous Function (anon)
- Arrow Function (arrow)
- Async Function (async)
- Condition Block (cond)
- Console Log (log)
- Export statement -- single variable (export)
- Export statement -- object literal (exportObj)
- Function (fn)
- Generator (generator)
- Lambda function (lfn)
- Immediately Invoked Function Expression (iife)
- Member Function (mfn)
- Prototypal Object Definition (proto)
- Require statement (require)
- Try/Catch Block (tryCatch)
- Use Strict (strict)

### Usage

Type the abbreviation, such as fn, in your code and hit enter. When the snippet is executed, the appropriate code will be
inserted into your document. Any snippets which require extra information like names or arguments will have named
tab-stops where you can fill in the information unique to your program.

### Explanations

**anon** Inserts a tab-stopped anonymous function snippet into your code

**export** Adds a module.exports single var assignment in your module

**exportObj** Adds a module.exports assignment with an object literal

**fn** Inserts a tab-stopped named function snippet into your code

**lfn** Inserts a tab-stopped lambda function snippet into your code

**iife** Inserts a new, tab-stopped IIFE into your code

**mfn** Inserts a new color-delimited member function to your prototype -- Protip be inside a prototype object when using this.

**require** Inserts a new require statement in your module

**strict** Inserts 'use strict' into your code

### Contribution Rules and Guidelines

JS Refactor is open to pull requests for everything from code to documentation.  As with any project, there are certain
needs which must be addressed.  JS Refactor is, at its core, still in development. Since it was built on an early version
of Visual Studio Code, so there is a fair amount of code that was originally exploratory in nature. In its current state, 
JS Refactor is fully tested and behaviors are vice-tested into place.  Going forward, code will be cleaned and, itself,
refactored, so a style guide is going to be relatively fluid.

Nevertheless, following are the required elements of a good pull request:

- **Code updates must be covered by a test.**
- **Code must follow existing standards as they are available.**
- **All existing behaviors must continue to function as designed.**
- **All tests must continue to pass. Any pull requests with failing tests cannot be accepted.**
- **Pull request must explain changes which are made, referring to an issue number as available.**
- **Pull requests may not be claimed as intellectual property of a company or other external agency.**
